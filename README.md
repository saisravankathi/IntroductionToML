# IntroductionToML
How to use CNN and ANN in deeplearning to identify the hand written digits.


# DeepLearning is the root directory in which DeepLearning.ipynb has all the basics of python, numpy and matplotlib.
In this Jupyter notebook file, you will come across the brief introduction to the above libraries and Machine Learning definitions, which are written in plain english.

# DeepLearning > ImageClassificatino
In this folder, there are two jupyter notebook files.
They need to be studied in the following order.
* NeuralNets.ipynb, in this you could find the basics to ANN's, One hidden layer and multiple hidden layer networks to identify the handwritten digits( MNIST Dataset is being used to train the model).
* Keras library is used to create the model to recognize the hand written digits, which uses tensor flow as backend.
* CNN.ipynb, this has the code for developing convolutional neural networks, which is not updated and has some errors in it.


# Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter notebook can store live code in it, where we could execute the snippets of code.

To view the files having extension .ipynb, please follow the below steps.

* Download and install Python 3.XX
* Once installation is done, open the python shell and type in "import jupyter" if everything works fine then proceed to the next step if not use the command "pip install jupyter" for windows users and "pip3 install jupyter" for linux users in cmd or terminal respectively.
* Once jupyter is installed, please install "numpy", "matplotlib", "tensorflow", "keras" and "pillow" libraries.

After succesfully completing the above steps, please open cmd or terminal and enter "jupyter notebook" which run a localserver from where you could access the directories.

Browse to the Deeplearning directory and open the .ipynb files.
